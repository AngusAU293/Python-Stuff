## About
This Python program is a video player that allows you to play videos in Python.

## How to use
All of the secrets are in the Installer file.
Simpily download it, then run it (you need to have Python installed*).

You will notice a folder being created and in the folder is all the stuff to make it run.

*An EXE file might be made for the installer, and possibly for the rest.
